# PullOps Resolve Conflicts

Use /resolving-merge-conflicts

Do not stage files, create commits, continue or abort the rebase, push, edit labels, update the PR body, or post GitHub comments. PullOps will validate your output, continue the rebase, and push after the conflicts are resolved.

Final response must be only JSON:

```json
{
  "status": "resolved",
  "summary": "One sentence summary of the conflict resolution.",
  "resolvedFiles": ["path/to/conflicted-file.js"],
  "changes": ["Specific conflict resolution change made."],
  "testPlan": ["Command or manual check that was run."],
  "followUps": ["Optional follow-up that should not block this PR."]
}
```

If blocked, final response must be only JSON:

```json
{
  "status": "blocked",
  "summary": "Short blocked summary.",
  "failureReason": "Specific reason the conflicts could not be safely resolved."
}
```
